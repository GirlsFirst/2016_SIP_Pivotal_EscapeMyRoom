Synopsis
	Escape the Room games are really fun, but it’s a lot of work to plan and it’s expensive to pay for a large group to go.
Code Example
	N/A
Motivation
	Escape rooms are always very costly and also inconvenient. You have to go out of your way to find a place, book it, and pay a lot of money. If people wanted to do it in the spur of the moment, they wouldn’t be able to either.

Installation
	We have a website that you can download the PDF file of the zapcodes from, for a small fee. Users also have to download a free app called Zappar, that allows you to scan codes and see the clues.

API Reference
	We don't have any API's in our product right now, however we plan to have a wallet API in the future.

Tests
	We repeatedly ran our website, and changed code one line at a time. This way, if something breaks, we know what to fix.
Contributors
	Some ideas to add to our project are to incorporate some new APIS (for example: payment API), create a login backend system, or create some new game packages. 

License
	We employ a MIT License for our product.
